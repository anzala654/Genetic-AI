    "The provided Python code implements a genetic algorithm to tackle the knapsack problem, a classic optimization challenge. The algorithm begins by defining the problem parameters, such as the maximum weight allowed and a list of items with associated weights and values. Individuals in the population are represented as binary strings, indicating whether an item is selected or not. The fitness of each individual is evaluated based on the total value of selected items while penalizing solutions exceeding the weight limit. The algorithm iteratively evolves the population through tournament selection, single-point crossover, and mutation over a specified number of generations. The best individual in each generation, along with its fitness, is tracked and printed. Finally, the algorithm returns the best solution found, showcasing the optimal combination of items and its associated fitness. Users can customize the code for different instances of the knapsack problem by adjusting problem parameters and operators accordingly."
